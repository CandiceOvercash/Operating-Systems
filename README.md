# Operating-Systems

Provide the computer science students a thorough understanding of
the concepts and principles of operating systems and an appreciation of the implementation issues. This
course covers fundamental concepts and algorithms of operating systems. In particular, the course covers
four major OS subsystems: process management (processes, threads, CPU scheduling, synchronization,
and deadlock), memory management (segmentation, paging, swapping, virtual memory), I/O hardware and
software, and fle systems.
